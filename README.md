This repository contains my CUDA C/C++ project which contains the program for Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm. I've created kernels for the different processes happening. I tried with device functions but for some reason i couldn't get the code to work. If anybody can get the code to work or optimise it,it would be a big help. 
Thank you.
